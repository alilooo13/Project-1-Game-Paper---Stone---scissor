# Project-1-Game-Paper---Stone---scissor
This is a fully functional C++ console implementation of the classic Rock–Paper–Scissor game, to practice and combine multiple core programming concepts in a single, structured application.  Rather than focusing on one isolated concept, this project brings together game logic, user interaction, basic AI behavior, and structured program design, making it a strong beginner-to-intermediate level portfolio project.

🧠 Concepts & Skills Applied

While developing this project, I practiced and applied the following C++ concepts:

Random Number Generation

Used rand() with srand(time(NULL)) to generate unpredictable computer choices.

User Input Handling & Validation

Read player input safely and handled invalid choices to prevent crashes or logical errors.

Enums for Clean Game Logic

Used enum types to represent game choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors) and round winners.

Conditional Logic

Implemented game rules using if statements and switch-case structures.

Structures (Structs)

Stored round data and overall game results in structured data types.

Loops (for / while)

Managed multiple rounds and replay functionality using loops.

Functions & Return Values

Broke the program into reusable functions such as:

Reading player choices

Determining round winners

Determining the overall game winner

String Manipulation

Converted enum values into human-readable output for clear game results.

Score Tracking

Tracked player wins, computer wins, and draws across multiple rounds.

Basic AI Simulation

Implemented a simple computer opponent using random decision-making.

System Calls

Used system("cls") to refresh the console between games (Windows).

Debugging & Output Formatting

Displayed clean, readable game summaries and round results.
